## Composition

Vim powerfulness and magic lives in its compositional nature.

We can distinguish between three kind of primitives:

- Motions
- Operators
- Text objects

## Save and exit

Pressing `:` you'll be prompted to write in the lower bar.
It's used for a really infinite uses.

One of those are:
@ul
- `:w` for writing
- `:q` for exiting
- `:q!` for exiting forcefully
- `:wq` for saving and exit
