@ul
- @color[#f49e42](_) current line
- @color[#f49e42](iw) current word

@ulend

### There are also more powerful text objects

- @color[#f49e42](i") for text between quotes
- with @color[#f49e42](a") you includes quotes too

<br>
### This is not limited at quotes!

- @color[#f49e42](i(, a(, i[, i{, i<) works as you expect

## Let's try!
<br>
> vim @color[#f49e42](01_objects.txt)
<br>
> spoiler: exit with @color[#f49e42](:q!)
