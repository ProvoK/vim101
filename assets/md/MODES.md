This is the default mode and one of the most powerful ones.

> Pressing keys will not (most of time) write anything. PANIC

+++

## Insert

In this mode Vim will behave as a common text editor.

> I type. I see. Relief.

## Visual

In this mode you actually make selections, like the ones you do dragging the mouse around.

> Oh gawd. I should have exited by now.
