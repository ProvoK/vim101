## Modes

What distinguish Vim by most of the text editors are @color[#f49e42](modes)

@ul
- @color[#f49e42](Normal/Command)
- @color[#f49e42](Insert)
- @color[#f49e42](Visual)
@ulend

+++

## Normal

In this mode you @color[#f49e42](move) into and between files,
<br>@color[#f49e42](run commands) and much more.
<br>@color[#f49e42](Exiting included.)
<br>
This is the default mode and one of the most powerful ones.

> Pressing keys will not write anything. PANIC MODE

+++

## Insert

In this mode Vim will behave as a common text editor.

> I type. I see. Relief.

+++

## Visual

In this mode you actually make selections,
<br>much like the ones you do dragging the mouse around.

> Oh gawd. I should have quit by now.


+++

## Mode switching

There are multiple ways to switch modes.

@ul
- @color[#f49e42](ESC) will bring you back to normal mode
- @color[#f49e42](i) will switch to insert mode
    + there are actually a lot of alternatives, we'll see them later
- @color[#f49e42](v) will start visual mode
@ulend

### @color[#f49e42](ESC) will save your life
