## Configuration

Vim has not visual settings/preferences and so on.

Everything (plugins too!) is stored in a special file:
<br>
@color[#f49e42](.vimrc)
<br>
which is usually located in your home directory

+++

## Bare minimal Vim configuration

+++?code=.vimrc?lang=vim
@[1-2](set language for the editor)
@[4-5](show the current position)
@[7-8](highlight the current line. Useful for not getting lost)
@[10-11](you can't survive without this)
@[12](just one of default colorscheme)
@[14-15](line numbers, again super duper necessary)

+++

## Use and play with it

Copy the file in your @color[#f49e42]($HOME) directory

> cp .vimrc ~/.vimrc
