## Composition

Vim powerfulness and magic lives in its @color[#f49e42](compositional) nature.

We can distinguish between three kind of primitives:

@ul
- @color[#f49e42](Motions)
- @color[#f49e42](Operators)
- @color[#f49e42](Text objects)
@ulend

+++

You'll @color[#f49e42](compose) them mostly in this manner

{ @color[#f49e42](number) }{ @color[#f49e42](operator) }{ @color[#f49e42](text object) or @color[#f49e42](motion) }
